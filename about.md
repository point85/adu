<h3>3D Viewer Model</h3>
Chief Architect's help on using the 3D Viewer Model may be found here. After the web page is displayed, click on "Load Model" to view the ADU in basic mode. When using the viewer, a more realistic experience can be obtained by setting the viewer to standard mode instead of basic. To do this, select "Rendering Techniques >" then "Standard".  Click on "Cameras >" and choose an available camera view as a starting point. The perspective is the default view. A dollhouse view is created from a horizontal cross-section.

<h3>Layout File</h3>
After downloading the layout PDF file, it can be printed. The original size is Architectural C (18" x 24"), therefore the printer needs to maintain this aspect ratio in order to print correctly.

<h3>Chief Architect Backup File</h3>
After downloading the Chief Architect backup file, expand the archive into a folder of your choice. Using Home Designer Professional 2023 version or higher (or Chief Architect Premier), open the .plan file. You will now have full access to all capabilities of the program.
