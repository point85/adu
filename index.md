Point 85 offers a variety of detailed plans for one and two bedroom Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). The plans have been created by [Home Designer Professional](https://www.homedesignersoftware.com/products/home-designer-pro/) from Chief Architect. 

For each ADU a link is provided to Chief Architect's 3D viewer application where one can take a virtual tour of the house. Each plan also has two downloads: (1) a layout drawing in Architectural C size with the dimensioned floor plan, elevations, doll-house and perspective views, and (2) a backup of the Home Designer plan. For more information on these items, please see the About section.
